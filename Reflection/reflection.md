# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian. 

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to Google around a bit before answering!)

### The purpose of semantic elements such as <header> <article> and <section> tags is to provide additional information about your code. Semantic tags not only seperate content in large codes, making it easier for the developer to work on it, but it actually also helps the browser understand what the meaning of the page is. For example, the <article> element will tell the browser that the content should be seperated from the rest of the page. Additionally, by using semantic elements you're breaking up, or seperating sections of your code. This is useful when you're trying to style particular sections of a document. Another reason why semantic elements are important is that search engines (google for exampel) has an algorithmic criteria that requires certain elements,that developers need to implement in a  page in order to rank higher on search results. For users with disabilities, semantic elements help screen readers navigate a page.



## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.

### 1. The first presentation displays a picture of Ada in the center of the page with key figures behind her. These individuals are the people who played a significant role in her life (her mother, father, tutor, publisher etc). If this design was working, users would be able to hover over each figure. The user would then have the option to expand the individual, where a text would pop up stating how they had an impact on Ada's life. The purpose of visualizing data this way is to give an element of user interaction; making the learning process more engaging and therefore more interesting.

### 2. The second representation is acting as a homepage to a main ‘Ada Lovelace’ site with numerous different subpages linked on the navigation bar (i.e., Her work, Early Life, Upbringing, Professional Career, People). The navigation bar is centered in the screen to act as a redirect to different pages where users can choose to learn more if they opt to. This helps users find the information they’re looking for without having to scroll through huge blocks of text. It also doesn't force the users to read things that they're not interested in on the home page. However, the main column on the home page is a picture of Ada with featured text underneath. Because this is the center point of the website, it gives newcomers an introduction to what the site is about.
