            <p>Ada Lovelace, also known as the “enchantress of numbers,” was born on December 10, 1815, in London, England. She was the daughter of famed poet Lord George Gordon Byron and Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron. From her mothers encouragement and insistence, her tutoring focused on math and science. Her mother encouraged this field because she thought it would counteract her fathers poetic tendencies (i.e., being moody and temperamental). In the 1840s, despite barriers in the field towards women, Ada wrote the world’s first machine algorithm for an early computing machine. Consequently, she has been considered the first computer programmer. However, her computer science work wasn’t found until the 1950s, when B.V. Bowden republished her notes in “Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines” (1953). <br>

              In 1980, the United States Department of Defense named a programming language “Ada” in memory of her. Additionally, as a result of Ada’s accomplishments, October 8th was named Ada Lovelace Day. The day is a “celebration of the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering and maths”. The day also aims to highlight prominent women in STEM, and by doing so, encourage more girls and women to get involved in the field.
